This week, the team focused on integrating all parts of the system, making them work together.
That entailed making the communication between the totem and the server work, as well as between the Raspberry Pi and the ESP32 and between the Raspberry Pi and the tablet UI.
Although that integration is now mostly done, there are some more tests that still need to be done.
