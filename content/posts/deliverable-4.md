This week, the team's effort was channeled towards finishing the electronical implementation, aswell as begining the software implementation.

# Electronics

## Board

## Improved Schematics

# Software

## Backend
In terms of software, we have finished implementing the backend,
which is composed of 2 different services: the **Storate Service**,
that handles patients, reports and employees, and the **Audio and Text Service**,
which exposes endpoints for **Speech To Text (STT)** and **Text To Speech (TTS)** .

## Raspberry Pi
We also began integrating the code handled by the Raspberry Pi into a cohesive program.

This is the example output of a test done using the Gemini LLM for generating questions.
